A farming tool for the video game Genshin Impact, designed to assist players in tracking daily farming tasks and the materials needed to build their characters. The tool includes a list of characters being built and the resources needed for each.

This website is built with React.js and Vite, and I am using npm package from https://github.com/theBowja/genshin-db that provides in-game data.
